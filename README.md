# InspoQuotes 
An iOS app that follows the "freemium" model. Gives you access to a few free quotes at first and then more upon purchase.

Through developing this app, I gained and solidified knowledge in various learning topics, including...
* How to setup new in-app purchases on App Store Connect
* How to use the StoreKit API to allow users to purchase premium content
* How to use the StoreKit API to detect failure cases
* How to use the StoreKit API to restore in-app purchases
* How to persist the state of users' purchase
